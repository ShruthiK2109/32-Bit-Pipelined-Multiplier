# 32-Bit-Pipelined-Multiplier
4-Input 32-bit Unsigned Pipelined Multiplier

This project implements a high-speed, hardware-efficient 4-input 32-bit unsigned multiplier using a pipelined architecture in Verilog. The design supports continuous data input and computes the final product of four unsigned 32-bit operands across multiple clock cycles. This multiplier is ideal for throughput-critical applications such as DSP and embedded processing.

Design Overview:

Inputs and Outputs:

Inputs: Four 32-bit unsigned integers (in1, in2, in3, in4).​

Output: One 128-bit unsigned integer (final_result) representing the product of the four inputs.​

Clock Signal: A clock input (clk) synchronizes the pipeline stages.​

Pipeline Stages:

Stage 1: Initial Multiplications

Multiplies in1 with in2, and in3 with in4 in parallel.​

Stores the resulting two 64-bit products in intermediate registers (stage1_ab and stage1_cd).​

Stage 2: Intermediate Registering

Transfers the values from stage1_ab and stage1_cd to the next set of registers (stage2_ab and stage2_cd) to maintain data synchronization.​

Stage 3: Final Multiplication

Multiplies the values in stage2_ab and stage2_cd to produce the final 128-bit result (final_result).​

Operational Flow:

On each clock cycle, new input values can be fed into the multiplier.​

After an initial latency of three clock cycles (one for each pipeline stage), the pipeline reaches a steady state where it outputs a new 128-bit product every clock cycle.​

This pipelined approach allows for overlapping operations, significantly increasing throughput compared to a non-pipelined multiplier.​

Computation:

If all inputs are set to 2, the computation proceeds as follows:​

Stage 1: Calculate 2 × 2 = 4 for both pairs, storing 4 in stage1_ab and stage1_cd.​

Stage 2: Transfer 4 from stage1_ab to stage2_ab, and from stage1_cd to stage2_cd.​

Stage 3: Compute 4 × 4 = 16, storing 16 in final_result.​

After three clock cycles, the output final_result will hold the value 16.
