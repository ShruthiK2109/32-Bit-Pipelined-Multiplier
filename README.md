# 32-Bit-Pipelined-Multiplier
4-Input 32-bit Unsigned Pipelined Multiplier

This project implements a high-speed, hardware-efficient 4-input 32-bit unsigned multiplier using a pipelined architecture in Verilog. The design supports continuous data input and computes the final product of four unsigned 32-bit operands across multiple clock cycles. This multiplier is ideal for throughput-critical applications such as DSP and embedded processing.
